# Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis

## Description
This project uses MS Excel for data cleaning, My SQL to analyze the dataset and Power BI for data visualization of an online E-Commerce platform. The goal of the project is to answer a set of questions about the  business performance and help in its growth by making better decisions.

##Questions Answered
* Which product categories are performing below and above the overall business profit margin?
* Which sub-categories are causing margin leakage within low-performing categories?
* How does shipping cost affect profit margins across different shipping modes?
* Does longer delivery time negatively impact profitability or priority orders?

##Results

The results of the project are as follows:

* The overall profit margin of the company was approximately 22%.
* The Furniture category was identified as underperforming compared to other categories.
* Sub-categories such as Tables, Bookcases, and Machines showed lower profit margins.
* Same Day shipping incurred higher costs without generating proportionally higher profits.
* Medium priority orders demonstrated better profit margins compared to high priority orders.

##Conclusion

The analysis highlights pricing inefficiencies and cost structure challenges
affecting overall profitability. By optimizing category pricing, reducing
procurement costs, and aligning shipping charges with service levels, the
organization can significantly improve financial performance.
